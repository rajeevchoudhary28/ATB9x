1. Research about HTTP.

What is HTTP?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundational communication protocol of the web.
It defines how a client (like a browser or API client) communicates with a server.

It is: Stateless Text-based Request–response protocol

Used for websites, APIs, mobile apps, IoT, microservices communication.

🧩 How HTTP Works (Simple Explanation)

Client sends a request to the server
(Browser, Postman, Mobile App, Automation script)

Server processes the request

Server sends a response containing: Status code Headers Optional body (HTML / JSON / file)

This cycle repeats for every request because HTTP is stateless—each request is independent.
