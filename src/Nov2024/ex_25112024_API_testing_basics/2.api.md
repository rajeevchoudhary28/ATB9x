- What Is API Testing?

API Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
Instead of testing a UI, you test the request → response behavior of backend services directly.

✔ API Testing checks:

Functionality – Does the API return correct results?
Reliability – Does it work consistently?
Performance – How fast/stable is it?
Security – Authentication, authorization, data protection.
Data Validation – Correct structure, schema, and formatting.

✔ It's done at the service layer (backend)
You bypass the UI and send HTTP requests directly.

Example API request:

GET https://api.example.com/users/12

🧪 Why Is API Testing Important?

Finds issues early before UI is built.
Faster and more stable than UI tests.
Essential for microservices environments.
Ensures proper communication between services.

🔧 How To Do API Testing (Step-by-Step)
1. Understand the API

You need:

API endpoints
HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
Request/Response structure

Headers
Authentication (API Key, OAuth, JWT)

Usually available in:
Swagger / OpenAPI documentation

Postman collection
Developer API docs

2. Choose API Testing Tools

Popular tools:

⭐ Manual/Automation

Postman – Manual + automated tests
Swagger (OpenAPI) – Testing via UI
SoapUI – API functional testing
Insomnia – API debugging

⭐ Automation with Code

Python – requests, pytest, pytest-bdd
Java – RestAssured
JavaScript – SuperTest, Axios + Jest
Katalon Studio

3. Send Test Requests

Start with basic operations:

Example (GET request)
GET /user/1


Check:

Status code = 200
Response time < threshold
JSON structure is valid

4. Validate the Response

You must check the following:

✔ Status Codes

200 OK
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
404 Not Found
500 Server Error

✔ Response Body

Check schema, fields, data types.

✔ Response Time

Example: Should be < 500 ms.

✔ Response Headers

Content-Type, Cache, Auth headers etc.

5. Write Automated Test Scripts

Example in Python + Pytest:

import requests

def test_get_user():
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/user/1")
assert response.status_code == 200
data = response.json()
assert data["id"] == 1
assert "email" in data

6. Include Positive and Negative Tests
   ✔ Positive tests:

Create user with valid data

Get valid IDs

Update valid records

✔ Negative tests:

Invalid input types

Missing fields

Invalid auth token

Hitting rate limits

7. Test Authentication

Types:

API Key

JWT (Bearer token)

OAuth2

Basic Auth

Example:

Authorization: Bearer <token>

8. Use Mock Servers (Optional)

Useful when backend is not ready.

Tools:

Postman Mock Server

WireMock

Swagger Mock Server

9. Integrate with CI/CD

Run API automation on:

Jenkins

GitHub Actions

GitLab CI

Azure DevOps

Test execution triggers:

On commit

On merge request

Nightly run

📘 Types of API Testing
1. Functional Testing

Check output correctness.

2. Load/Performance Testing

Check throughput and stability under load (e.g., JMeter).

3. Security Testing

Test token validation, encryption, access rights.

4. Contract Testing

Ensure services follow API schema.
Tools: Pact, Swagger Validator

5. Integration Testing

Verify communication between microservices.

🏗 Example Test Cases for API Testing
✔ Functional Test Case

Test: GET /products
Expected: 200, JSON list > 0, correct schema.

✔ Negative Test Case

Test: POST /login with invalid password
Expected: 401 Unauthorized

✔ Performance

Test: 1000 concurrent users
Expected: Response time < 1s

🧰 Sample Workflow for Beginners

Import API collection into Postman
Create test requests
Add test scripts inside Postman
Automate using Postman Runner / Newman
When comfortable, shift to scripting (Python/Java)
Add test suites to CI/CD

📌 Summary

API Testing = Testing backend services directly without UI.

You test:

Endpoints
Input/Output
Behavior
Performance
Security

You use tools like:
Postman
Python/Java
Swagger
JMeter
RestAssured

You check:

Status codes
JSON structure
Business logic
Error handling
Auth
