🌐 HTTP vs HTTPS
🔸 What is HTTP?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to transfer data between a client (browser/ app) and a server.

Works on port 80

Unsecured → data is sent as plain text

Anyone intercepting the traffic can read/modify it

Used for general browsing (not recommended today)

🔹 What is HTTPS?

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP.

Works on port 443

Uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data

Ensures:

🔒 Confidentiality

✔ Integrity

🛂 Authentication

Mandatory for websites, APIs, banking, login pages

🔍 Key Differences: HTTP vs HTTPS
Feature	HTTP	HTTPS
Security	Not secure	Encrypted & secure
Data Transfer	Plain text	Encrypted with SSL/TLS
Port	80	443
URL Prefix	http://	https://
Certificate	No certificate required	Requires SSL/TLS certificate
SEO	Lower ranking	Better ranking (Google prefers HTTPS)
Performance	Slightly faster (older days)	HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 make HTTPS faster now
Use Cases	Non-sensitive browsing	Secure websites, APIs, payments
🔐 Why HTTPS Is More Secure

HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to provide:

✔ 1. Encryption

Even if someone captures traffic, they cannot read it.

✔ 2. Authentication

Confirms you're communicating with the real server.

✔ 3. Data Integrity

Data cannot be modified during transmission.

🚀 Which One Should You Use?

Always HTTPS.
Modern browsers label HTTP sites as "Not Secure".

APIs, e-commerce, banking, login systems → must use HTTPS.

🎯 Summary

HTTP = simple, fast, but unsecured

HTTPS = secure, encrypted, trusted

HTTPS protects users and helps with SEO and credibility
