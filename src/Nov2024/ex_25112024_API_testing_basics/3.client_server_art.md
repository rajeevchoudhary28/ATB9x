🖥️ What Is Client–Server Architecture?

Client–Server Architecture is a computing model where two main components interact:

Client → Requests a service

Server → Provides the service

This model is the foundation of the web, APIs, mobile apps, and most distributed systems.

⚙️ How It Works (Simple Flow)

Client sends a request
Example: a browser requesting a webpage.

Server receives the request
Server process handles logic, database queries, authentication, etc.

Server sends a response back
HTML, JSON, image, file, or any data.

➡️ It follows a request → response cycle.

🧩 Components of Client–Server Architecture
1. Client

Device or application used by the user

Examples:

Browser (Chrome, Firefox)

Mobile app

API testing tools (Postman)

IoT device

2. Server

A powerful computer that stores, processes, and delivers data

Types:

Web server

Application server

Database server

File server

🔄 Characteristics of Client–Server Architecture
✔ Distributed System

Clients and servers are separate systems connected via a network (LAN or Internet).

✔ Scalable

Multiple clients can connect to one server.

✔ Centralized Resources

Data, logic, security rules reside on the server.

✔ Stateless or Stateful

Depends on implementation (e.g., HTTP is stateless).

🧱 Types of Client–Server Models
1️⃣ 1-Tier Architecture

Everything on one machine (rare today).

2️⃣ 2-Tier Architecture

Client ↔ Server (traditional client-server model)

3️⃣ 3-Tier Architecture

Client ↔ Application Server ↔ Database
(Most common in enterprise systems)

4️⃣ N-Tier Architecture

Multiple layers:
Client → API Gateway → Microservices → Database → Cache

📌 Examples in Real Life
✔ Opening a website

Browser = Client
Web Server (Apache, NGINX) = Server

✔ Using an online banking app

Mobile app = Client
Bank backend system = Server

✔ API Testing with Postman

Postman = Client
API server = Server

📦 Advantages

Centralized control

Easy maintenance

Scalable

Secure

Supports thousands/millions of users

🚫 Disadvantages

Server overload if too many clients

Network dependency

Higher server cost

🎯 In Summary

Client–Server architecture is a model where clients request services and servers fulfill them.
It powers almost everything you do online: websites, APIs, mobile apps, cloud systems, etc.
